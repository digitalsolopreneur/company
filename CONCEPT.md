# Concept about Collaboration

**WORK IN PROGRESS - feel free to open and discuss issues**

## Wishes
1. All the rules combined should be as short as possible - would be wonderful if it fits in less than 1x DIN A4

## @TODO
1. Refince Concept
2. Use "Occam's razor" method to refactor the rules below

## Inspiration
* See [A cryptocurrency I'd like to see](https://github.com/serapath/economy/issues/2)
* See [What is money?](https://github.com/serapath/economy/issues/1)

## Example
* Project `P`
* Founder `A` of `P`
* Early Collaborators `B`, `C`, `D` (within the first months)
* Recently joined Collaborators `E`, `F`, `G` (right now - 8 months in)
* Potential new joinees `H`, `I` and Collaborator `C` wnats to leave

*=> How to co-own and how to co-decide and how to steer Project `P`?*


### How to join as a collaborator?
* ...

### How to leave from being a collaborator?
* ...

### Points `p`
* Special Project Points `p` exist
* Every **Collaborator** `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G` owns an amount X of p

### What can be done with points `p`?
* Every proposal can be voted on using Points `p` and once decided for it, everyone is bound to the proposal
  * Every **Collaborator** can come up with proposals `Px`
  * Every potential proposal has at least one counter proposal which is in-action
  * Points 'p' used are then equally redistributed to every Collaborator
* Points can also be given to anyone, essentially giving them limited collaborator powers (but not necessarily the status of collaborator?)
* Anyone can put on a Task that needs to be done and put any amount of point `p`
  for successful execution of the task, then transfering `p` (+/-) bonus to the executor(s)

### How to mint `p`'s and who gets them?
At all times...
* A rate `Rp` exists at which new `p's` are created or destroyed
* Every Collaborator can vote on `Rp`, the median is chosen from given votes

### What rules around `p`'s exist?
* **Community Service Price**
  * A rate `Rr` exists at which existing `p's` are equally re-distributed
  * Every Collaborator can vote on `Rr`, the median is chosen from given votes
